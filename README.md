# Pixel Art Dailies

## Introduction

Part of the challenge of game development is making assets, including music, sound FX, and graphical assets such as sprites and meshes. As part of my journey into getting better at game development, I've decided to start making my own assets, and so I've undertaken a daily pixel art challenge. Each day will feature a different pixel art [based on a different theme](https://twitter.com/Pixel_Dailies). The sprites will be developed in [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) and the repo will include the aseprite files.
